# RegEx (Regular Expression) Tutorial / breakdown 

This repo/gist will be discussing what a Regular Expression (RegEX for short) is and the process used to implement this function into your own application. 

## Summary

Briefly summarize the regex you will be describing and what you will explain. Include a code snippet of the regex. Replace this text with your summary.

## Regex Components

### Anchors

Anchors are a different breed when it comes to the rest of the other regex symbols syntax. __*They do not match any character at all*__. Instead, they match a position before, after, or between characters. They can be used to “anchor” the regex match at a certain position.
  - For example, this is an email regex to verify a users email input ```/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/```. Now using a beginning ```^``` and ending ```$``` Anchor before the @ symbol would look like this ```/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)$/```. 

Symbol  | Description
------------- | -------------
^  | The caret ^ matches the position before the first character in the string. Applying ^a to abc matches a. ^b does not match abc at all, because the b cannot be matched right after the start of the string, matched by ^.
$  | Similarly, $ matches right after the last character in the string. c$ matches c in abc, while a$ does not match at all.

### Quantifiers

Example: if you are looking for matches for 4 digits, you can do ```/\d\d\d\d/```, or you can use quantifiers and do ```/\d{4}/```.

Symbol  | Description
------------- | -------------
{} | Quantifiers match a number of instances of a character, group, or character class in a string.

'let str = 'ECMAScript 2020';
let re = /\d{4}/;

let result = str.match(re);

console.log(result);'

Output will be ```2020```

### Character Classes

Symbol  | description
------------- | -------------
[ ]  | Character classes matches any single character in a range or set enclosed in square  brackets. For example, [aeiou] matches any vowel. You can also use a shorthand notation for a range of characters. For example, [0-9] matches any decimal digit. If the sequence is preceded by a carat:    ^   it matches any single character NOT from the range or set. For example, [^a-z] matches any character that is not a letter in the alphabet.
